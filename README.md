# Kinks-based initialization for deep networks

Testing the idea of a kinks-based initializer, an improved initialization
method for 1D inputs and a relu network. The idea is to initialize the
parameters such that the relu discontinuities are distributed evenly between
data points.

Run `deep_regression.py --help` for options.
